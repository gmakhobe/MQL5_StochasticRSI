# Stochastic RSI

This is an MQL5 project, the code is written so that it runs on a metatrader5 and the extension that is executed on the terminal is of the .ex5 group of extension

### About the indicator
Stochastic RSI is an oscilator indicator the oscilates between the values of 0 and 100 or 0 and 1 it is derived from the RSI indicator in which is fine tuned to determine overbought and over sold market conditions.

### My contribution

Since the Metatrader does not offer the stochastic rsi indicator on my end I am building the Stochastic RSI indicator by processing the RSI values to produce the KValue and the DValue per the logic from [WallStreetMojo](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/stochastic-rsi/) so that I could use this indicator on the Link Ol System I am currently building.

This is part of a greater picture.
